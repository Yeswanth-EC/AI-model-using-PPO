# AI-model-using-PPO
I built a Reinforcement Learning agent using PyTorch to teach a 2D robot how to walk in the Gymnasium BipedalWalker-v3 environment. I implemented the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm because its unique "clipping" feature provides much better stability and smoother learning compared to other RL methods.
