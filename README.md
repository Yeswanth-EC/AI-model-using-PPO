# AI-model-using-PPO
I built a Reinforcement Learning agent using PyTorch to teach a 2D robot how to walk in the Gymnasium BipedalWalker-v3 environment. I implemented the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm because its unique "clipping" feature provides much better stability and smoother learning compared to other RL methods. By using an Actor-Critic architecture in Google Colab, I was able to manage the complex physics and continuous joint torque required for movement. After extensive training and hyperparameter tuning, the agent went from constantly face-planting to successfully navigating the terrain with a consistent score of 300 . This project was a fantastic way to see how AI can master balance and coordination through trial and error!
